Two Part Project

1. Setting Up my Serverless Backend on AWS --------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Write a CloudFormation Template:
Start by defining my AWS infrastructure (Lambda, API Gateway, IAM roles) using CloudFormation. This sets the foundation for my serverless backend.

2. Develop AWS Lambda Functions:
Develop and test my Lambda functions, ensuring they are stateless and function correctly. I might consider using a language that aligns well with React's ecosystem, like Node.js.

3. Set Up AWS API Gateway:
Configure the API Gateway to create a front door for my Lambda functions, defining how my API will be accessed.

4. Deploy Using CloudFormation:
Deploy my infrastructure to AWS using the CloudFormation template, which brings my serverless backend to life.

5. Implement Version Control and CI/CD:
Set up a CI/CD pipeline for automated deployment of my backend, integrating with my version control system.

Test API Endpoints:
Test the deployed API endpoints to ensure they are working as expected.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Developing the React Application -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. React Project Setup:
Begin by setting up my React project and including necessary libraries for HTTP requests.

2. Integrate with the AWS Backend:
Connect my React application to the AWS backend using the API Gateway endpoints, ensuring communication between front and backend.

3. Develop UI and Features:
Build out my applicationâ€™s UI and features, integrating React components with backend logic.

4. Application Testing:
Test my React application thoroughly to ensure functionality and proper integration with the backend.
Deploy the React Application:
Deploy my React application to a suitable hosting service.

5. Ongoing Monitoring and Updates:
Regularly monitor, update, and maintain both the backend and frontend based on performance data and user feedback.
